_Hey There!_

Lets deep down into passing my Data Engineering Certification journey .
If I had 5 weeks to prepare for this exam again, how should I prepare to increase my chances of passing?
first question pop into mind like why GCP only , again I have valid reasons for it 

Why GCP Certifications Are Important
1. GCP is One of the Top 3 Cloud Leaders
A GCP certification (like Professional Data Engineer or Cloud Architect) proves that you can:
* Design and manage ETL pipelines
* Use tools like BigQuery, Dataflow, Pub/Sub, Dataproc, Cloud Storage
* Build secure, scalable, and reliable data solutions in the cloud

2. They Boost Career Growth and Visibility
Many hiring managers explicitly look for “Google Cloud Certified” professionals.
According to Google Cloud’s own research:
* Certified engineers see a 20–35% higher salary potential.
* 80% of certified professionals report career advancement or new roles within a year.
* It opens up opportunities in data engineering, cloud architecture, ML engineering, and analytics.

3. They’re Globally Recognized & Future-Oriented
* GCP is expanding fast in AI, ML, and DataOps, especially with Vertex AI and Gemini integrations.
* A GCP certification positions you for future technologies, not just current ones.
* It’s recognized by global companies across the US, Europe, and India — making your resume truly internationally competitive.

Exam format and registration details :
